/**
 * Implementation of a word for natural language processing.  Please note
 * that in general, one can only count on the <code>form</code> and
 * <code>capitalized</code> fields described below having meaningful values.
 * The <code>form</code> field can be assumed to be filled in because it's
 * hard to imagine a situation in which a <code>Word</code> object should be
 * created without any knowledge of how that word appeared in text.  The
 * <code>capitalized</code> field is computed from the <code>form</code> by
 * this class' constructor.
 * <p/>
 * <p> <i>All other fields must be obtained or computed externally.  Space is
 * provided for them in this class' implementation as a convenience, since we
 * expect the user will make frequent use of these fields.</i>
 * <p/>
 * <p> This class extends from {@link edu.illinois.cs.cogcomp.lbjava.parse.LinkedChild}.  Of course,
 * this means that objects of this class contain references to both the
 * previous and the next word in the sentence.  Constructors are available
 * that take the previous word as an argument, setting that reference.  Thus,
 * a useful technique for constructing all the words in a sentence will
 * involve code that looks like this (where <code>form</code> is a
 * {@link String}):
 * <p/>
 * <blockquote>
 * <code>
 * Word current = new Word(form);<br>
 * <i>a loop of some sort</i><br>
 * {<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current.next = new Word(form, current);<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current = current.next;<br>
 * }<br>
 * </blockquote>
