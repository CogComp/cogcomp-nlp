yes i know it s nowhere near christmas time but i m gonna loose net access in a few days maybe a week or if i m lucky and wanted to post this for interested people to save till xmas note bell labs is a good place if you have a phd and a good boss i have neither subject xmas light set with levels of brightness another version of a variable brightness xmas light set this set starts with a blinker bulb string diagram orginal way set 0v b b 0rtn modified set for level brightness string 0v 0k w string b 0v rtn note no mods to wiring to the right of this point only one blinker is used note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string bulbs because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it that s why the use of the 0k w resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing when the blinker goes open this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings s slightly dimmer s slightly brighter or use a w 0v bulb in place of the 0k resistor if you can get one caution do not replace with a standard c bulb as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker c approx w what you ll see when it s working powerup string will light at full brightness and b will be lit bypassing most of the current from the second string making them not light b will open placing both strings in series making the string that was out to glow at a low brightness and the other string that was on before to glow at reduced brightness be sure to wire and insulate the splices resistor leads and cut wires in a safe manner level brightness xmas light set for easter
