i m looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs a couple of issues ago pc mag listed as editor s choices both conversion artist and hijaak for windows anyone have any experience with those or some others i m trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days and i m not making much progress with the screen shots i m currently using dodot and i m about to burn it and the disks it rode it on it s got a lot of freaky bugs and oversights that are driving me crazy tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a tiff file that s under a certain arbitrary size it will swap the left and right sides of the picture usually it confines itself to not copying things to the clipboard so i have to save and load pix for editing in paintbrush or crashing every hour or so the one nice thing it has though is it s dither option you d think that this would turn colors into dots which it does if you go from say colors to colors but if you go from or colors to b w you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which turn to white for me this is useful because i can turn light grays on buttons to white and the dark grays to black and thereby preserve the d effect on buttons and other parts of the window if you understood my description can you tell me if another less buggy program can do this as well much thanks for any help signature david delgreco what lies behind us and what lies technically a writer before us are tiny matters compared delgreco rahul net to what lies within us oliver wendell holmes david f delgreco delgreco rahul net recommendation for screen capture program
