/**
 * This is a thread safe high speed NE tagger. It reads job definitions from an input queue,
 * executions the job as defined there as fast as it can, then will read the next job until it is
 * interrupted. One per CPU core can be created to execution at a very high rate limited by the
 * capabilities of the individual machine.
 * <p>
 * The Job definitions include a consumer and producer. The input data will come from the consumer
 * in the form of a string, the producer will take a view and produce whatever is needed. The
 * implementation of consumer and producer could easily be lambdas, they are intended to be very
 * simply yet flexible.
