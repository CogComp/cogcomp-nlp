Do you ever wonder why the people Brown employed felt able to behave for years in such a way ? They smeared the careers of Brown's opponents in the Labour Party, leaking information about private lives etc. But you are sure Brown himself "behaved properly". Might be worth googling the word "deniability".

Bosque, will you stop doing that, as I nearly had a heart attack. I thought I was going mad and written something totally different to what I thought I had.

But no! I went back to check, and I did indeed say:

I have no idea whether Brown was blameless. The only thing we can say is that he appears to have behaved properly in as far as we can tell.

I'm not sure how "...having no idea..." and "...appears..." is anything like being "...sure..".

With specific regards to his child's health, there have been rumblings for the last few hours that no hacking occured and that a "friend" leaked the information.

Link please.

That's certainly not what Brown is saying:

Nothing concrete yet- <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=tombradby&amp;original_referer=http://order-order.com/">just rumblings</a>. As I said, this is the only thing in a storm of flying muck, that is being refuted and there must be a reason for it.

One recalls Mr Brown attended Mrs Brooks' wedding weeks after The Sun broke their front page story about his child

<quote orig_author="Rock Da Bass">
I'm not sure why Rebekah Brooks is still in her job.

Newsnight ran an interview last night with Rupert Murdoch's biographer explaining it is a very tight knit familial group. He offered an anecdote that Rebekah Brooks quit smoking after losing a bet with Murdoch over who would win a swimming race. Quite they sacrificed NOTW to save executives and may well drop all their UK newspaper holdings to protect the company

No-one is taking responsibility. Not Rebekah Brooks or some other executive. Not Assistant Commissioner John Yates or another figure. Round and round we go

Completely agree. The Sun &amp; Sunday Times are small beer to this lot. Your going to protect the TV side of the business, 10M people in this country coughing up a minimum of Â£20 a month.

For me, the sickest things of all (regarding GB's son) isn't the hacking, it's (a) that The Sun thought this was a story in the public interest, and that (b) we live in a country where people buy a newspaper that saw fit to print the story.

Are you insufficiently repulsed by the Sun's mysteriously-obtained exclusive on Brown's son's cystic fibrosis? Don't worry - like everything about the hacking scandal, there are always more details to emerge to compound the horror. I've been speaking to a source close to Gordon Brown at the time of the story, who recalls that it was served up with a chaser of threat.

"Gordon insisted - despite a heavy brow-beating from Rebekah - that he was not willing to let his son's medical condition be the stuff of a Sun exclusive," recalls this source. "So he put out a statement on PA to spike their scoop and make clear that despite his condition, Fraser was fit and healthy. The Sun were utterly furious, and Brown's communications team were told that if Gordon wanted to get into No10, he needed to learn that was not how things were done."

Yes, how DARE the then-chancellor refuse to accept that his child's health was not technically a commercial Murdoch property? I'd like to tell you there's a sick bag located in the rear pocket of the seat in front of you. But I'm afraid you're on your own.

We haven't got to the bottom of this yet. Seriously Steve, when it comes to tabloids as a whole. I wouldn't put it past the Mirror looing into David Cameron's kids medical history. I think all this lot operate in a very shady way, I believe that will become apparent if they widen the net and move beyond just Murdoch's operation.
