EU backs stricter nuclear inspections in Iran
</HEADLINE>

LUXEMBOURG, June 16 (Xinhua)

Foreign ministers of the European Union (EU) said here Monday that
they fully supported stricter nuclear inspections of Iran's nuclear
programs by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

A statement issued at the two-day meeting of the EU foreign ministers
called on Iran to conclude and implement urgently and unconditionally
an additional protocol to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty
allowing for short-notice inspections of suspected nuclear sites in
the country.

It said that the EU was seriously concerned about Iran's nuclear
activities and urged it to cooperate fully with the IAEA.

"This would be a significant step in demonstrating Iran's stated
peaceful intentions with regard to its nuclear program," the
seven-point statement said.

George Papandreou, foreign minister of Greece, the current holder of
the EU presidency, said he was in personal contact with IAEA
Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei and would follow his lead on this
matter.

EU foreign ministers reiterated that improved trade links with Iran
should be conditional on Iran's cooperation.

They also said that the EU was closely following the nuclear issue
and would revert it to the forthcoming debate of the IAEA meeting on
Tuesday.
