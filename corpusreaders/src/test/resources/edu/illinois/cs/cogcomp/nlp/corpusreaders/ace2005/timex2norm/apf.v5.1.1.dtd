                             2000-01-05

v 1.1 Added versioning for semantic compatibility.
      Added CHARSEQ in reponse to request from George Doddington.
      Replaced ENTITY_NAME tag for encoding attribute with a general
      ENTITY_ATTRIBUTES tag within which can be multiple attributes,
      the only one of which we now have being NAME.

v 1.2 Added extra attributes to SOURCE_FILE element, indicating source,
      author and encoding.

v 1.3 Added ROLE attribute under entity_mention and added GENERIC attribute
      under entity_type.  Also added REFERENCE attribute to entity_mention
      to indicate whether literal or intended.  Also changed ID attribute value
      within document to CDATA (instead of ID)

v 1.4 Added support for RDC relations, their attributes and mentions.
      Also cleaned up and brought things up to date for EDT entities.
      2002/03/24.  David Day.

v 1.4.2 Removed rel_arg_role element, since this is now established within
        SUBTYPE attribute on relation elements.  Added NA as valid value for
        entity_mention REFERENCE attribute.
        2002/05/01.  David Day.

v 1.4.3 Changed all RELATION SUBTYPE values to use hyphens instead of underscore
        characters in the case of multi-word phrases (e.g., "LOCATED-IN").
        2002/05/28.  David Day.

v 1.4.4 Modified RELATION element SUBTYPE attribute values: Added BASED-IN.
        Removed NA from ENTITY_MENTION attribute values for ROLE and REFERENCE.
        Instead of being REQUIRED these attributes are now IMPLIED (that is,
        they are optional).

v 2.0   SUBTYPE modifications:
          Added:   CLIENT.
          Changed: MEMBER-OF to MEMBER.
          Removed: CONTAINED-IN.
        VERSION modifications:
          Changed: 1.4.4 to 2.0.
        David; 2002-06-20.

v 2.0.1 SUBTYPE modifications:
                  Added: FROM
                                 BRANCH
                             LOCATED-IN (LOCATED already existed; left both)
                Robyn; 2002-06-28

v 3.* became ALF (ACE LDC Format)

v 4.0.0 LDC and BBN update: updated to version 4.0.0 to match new ALF dtd

v 4.1.0 LDC: updated for the ACE4 Pilot exercise; 2004-11-11

v 4.2.0 LDC: updated for the ACE4 Pilot exercise; additional changes; 
        2004-11-15.

v 5.0.x LDC, NIST, MITRE: updated for the AC2005 Pilot exerecise to
        support the additional evaluation of Events and Entity
        Normalization & Disambiguation (END).  2004-11 through 2005-01.

v 5.1.0 LDC, ACE Community: Updated for the data for ACE 2005 training
        and evaluation data; Changed "quantity" to "value"; added new
        "timex2" and "timex2_mention" elements, and removed
        TIMEX2-related definitions from "value"; relation_mention and
        event_mention extents are now required; entity_mention heads are
        now required; updated types and subtypes; removed "PRE" from
        entity_mention TYPE and LDCTYPE; removed "CMC", "MWH" and "MSC"
        from entity_mention LDCTYPE; disallowed multiple anchors in
        event_mention; made the SUBTYPE attribute of entity to #REQUIRED

v 5.1.1 (1) TYPE="Life" SUBTYPE="Date" eliminated from event inventory.
        (2) Bounding box specification updated.

<!-- URI should be a unique identifier for the source file in question.
     SOURCE is a more general indicator of the news source from whence
       the source_file has been retrieved.  Likely values are CNN, APW,
       NPR, etc.
     TYPE indicates general class of signal (text, audio or image).
     VERSION attribute is used to perform optionaly versioning by
       matching against its value.
     AUTHOR attribute value should indicate the organization and/or
       person who produced the annotations contained in this file
       (e.g., "Ramshaw/BBN", "Ferro/MITRE", etc.).
     ENCODING indicates type-specific encoding standard being used

       signals, etc.

<!-- *********************************************************************

     The Entity Normalization and Disambiguation task defined for ACE
     requires that entities identified within a document must be
     associated with an element from some external resource.  The
     external_resource element declares the unique, universal URN that
     identifies this resource, and associates a locally unique NAME
     for the resource that may be used as an abbreviation within the
     APF file, and referenced from external_link elements (see further
     down in the DTD).

     The present types of elements that are currently expected to be
     linked to external resources are: entity.  In the future we may
     choose to link other types of elements (such as relation, event,
     value). to external resources.
