Cuban leader Fidel Castro is setting up a lavish extravaganza on the
island nation to welcome the new millennium, one year late for much
of the rest of the world. Many experts contend most of the world was
at least technically wrong by bringing in the new millennium with
massive celebrations last year. These experts point out that the
Gregorian calendar started in 1 AD and therefore, centuries'
millennia start with a one, not a zero. They say this makes 2001 the
first year of the third millennium. For those observing the start of
2001 as a true dawn of the twenty-first century, the parties and
fireworks are fewer and less elaborate than the 2000 celebrations.
In Cuba though, where President Castro had his country sit out last
year's revelry, they'll be making up for it as major festivities are
set.
