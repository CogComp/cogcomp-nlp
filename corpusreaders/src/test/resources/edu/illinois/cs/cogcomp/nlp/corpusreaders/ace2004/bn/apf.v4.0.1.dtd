			      A DTD for
		     Reference Key Annotation of
			   EDT Entities and
			 RDC Relations in the
			   ACE Evaluations

			  John C. Henderson
				MITRE
                             2000-01-05

v 1.1 Added versioning for semantic compatibility.
      Added CHARSEQ in reponse to request from George Doddington.
      Replaced ENTITY_NAME tag for encoding attribute with a general
      ENTITY_ATTRIBUTES tag within which can be multiple attributes,
      the only one of which we now have being NAME.

v 1.2 Added extra attributes to SOURCE_FILE element, indicating source,
      author and encoding.

v 1.3 Added ROLE attribute under entity_mention and added GENERIC attribute
      under entity_type.  Also added REFERENCE attribute to entity_mention
      to indicate whether literal or intended.  Also changed ID attribute value
      within document to CDATA (instead of ID)

v 1.4 Added support for RDC relations, their attributes and mentions.
      Also cleaned up and brought things up to date for EDT entities.
      2002/03/24.  David Day.

v 1.4.2 Removed rel_arg_role element, since this is now established within
        SUBTYPE attribute on relation elements.  Added NA as valid value for
        entity_mention REFERENCE attribute.
        2002/05/01.  David Day.

v 1.4.3 Changed all RELATION SUBTYPE values to use hyphens instead of underscore
        characters in the case of multi-word phrases (e.g., "LOCATED-IN").
        2002/05/28.  David Day.

v 1.4.4 Modified RELATION element SUBTYPE attribute values: Added BASED-IN.
        Removed NA from ENTITY_MENTION attribute values for ROLE and REFERENCE.
        Instead of being REQUIRED these attributes are now IMPLIED (that is,
        they are optional).

v 2.0   SUBTYPE modifications:
          Added:   CLIENT.
          Changed: MEMBER-OF to MEMBER.
          Removed: CONTAINED-IN.
        VERSION modifications:
          Changed: 1.4.4 to 2.0.
        David; 2002-06-20.

v 2.0.1 SUBTYPE modifications:
		  Added: FROM
				 BRANCH
			     LOCATED-IN (LOCATED already existed; left both)
		Robyn; 2002-06-28

v 3.* became ALF (ACE LDC Format)

v 4.0.0 LDC and BBN update: updated to version 4.0.0 to match new ALF dtd

<!-- URI should be a unique identifier for the source file in question.
     SOURCE is a more general indicator of the news source from whence
       the source_file has been retrieved.  Likely values are CNN, APW,
       NPR, etc.
     TYPE indicates general class of signal (text, audio or image).
     VERSION attribute is used to perform optionaly versioning by
       matching against its value.
     AUTHOR attribute value should indicate the organization and/or
       person who produced the annotations contained in this file
       (e.g., "Ramshaw/BBN", "Ferro/MITRE", etc.).
     ENCODING indicates type-specific encoding standard being used
       in source file, such as UTF-8 for text data, wav for speech
       signals, etc.

     final character in the span.

     A character SEQUENCE (charseq) is a pair of indices pointing to
     the first and last character of the text being annotated.  This
     means that the first index points to the first character of the
     text being annotated (which is the same as pointing to the
     imaginary gap *before* the first character), and the second index
     points to the last character in the annotated text (the imaginary
     gap *before* the last character in the annotated text). -->
