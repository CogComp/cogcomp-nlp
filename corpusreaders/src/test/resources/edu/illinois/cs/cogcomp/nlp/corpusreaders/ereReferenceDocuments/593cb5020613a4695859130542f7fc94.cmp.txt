I went to the doctor thursday and she changed the day of my induction from April 10th at 8:00am to April the 9th 8:00pm, so tommorow (well today). She moved it up because during my appt she did check me to see if i was dialated any and she said I was only dialated about a fingertip and so she went ahead and scheduled me to come in saturday at 8pm so I could start receiving medicine to open me up some more otherwise when they give me pictocin the labor would proably be long...so there gonna start the medicine saturday night to open me and then sunday morning give me the actual pictocin to make me go into labor...ladies..im freaking out...im so nervous/scared...this is my first pregnancy but im just so emotional and idk worried about everything...oh yeah and im getting induced because im diabetic.
       
                                                           
Inductions don't sound fun...good luck!!

I feel for you mama, I really do. For me, natural labor was quick and easy. Don't even want to imagine pitocin-induced contrax.                                                                       
       
                                                              
Aww! Good luck!

I know exactly how you feel. I went in for a similar situation. I had cervadil inserted at 4pm, they removed it and started the pitocin at 4am the following morning. The cervadil helped.. a little. I went in under unfavorable circumstances, but my labor went fantastic. By about 1pm I was in active labor and my son was born at 6:27pm that same day. It may not have been common, but it doesn't have to be a long process.

Eat well, rest up. Sunday (hopefully, if not Monday) you will be a momma. Life changes from this point forward - and I promise you, its worth every second of labor.

I'll be on the lookout for your birth story!
       
                                                             
With my first baby I was asked to come in 12 hours early to have my cervix softened prior to induction. (It was a small white square that looked like a piece of Excel gum. It wasn't fun really, but if you need to be induced then you have to do what you need to do. I had lots of cramping, couldn't rest...so it sucks that they have you coming in at night. Not to mention, the meds they give you tend to make the contractions stronger and more painful. I wound up getting an epidural during that one.                                                                        

It's the beginning of the end of your pregnancy! Be excited! Congrats!
