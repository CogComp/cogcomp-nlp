# Reader details

Each document is read into a `TextAnnotation` instance with the following views:

  - TOKENS: The basic `TokenLabelView` view generated by a `Tokenizer` from the raw dataset
  text
  - ENTITYVIEW: `SpanLabelView` with overlapping constituents where each constituent 
  represents a entity extent and head-word information is stored as attributes
  - RELATIONVIEW: `PredicateArgumentView` for storing relations. Predication 
  represents "Arg-1" and its corresponding Argument represents "Arg-2" 
  of the ACE Relation
  - COREF: `CoreferenceView` uses copies of mentions from ENTITYVIEW and adds the longest mention as the canonical mention + adds coreference edges to other mentions for the same entity.
