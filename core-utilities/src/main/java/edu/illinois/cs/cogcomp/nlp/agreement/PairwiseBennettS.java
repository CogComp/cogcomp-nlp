 * This coefficient is computed by assuming that each label is equally likely. It was first
 * descriebd in (Bennett, Alpert and Goldstein, 1954).
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> The coefficient S is problematic in many respects. The value of the coefficient can
 * be artifically increased by adding spurious categories. For more discussion, refer to (Artstein
 * and Poesio, 2008).
