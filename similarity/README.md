# Illinois Similarity

This module specifies a simple API for NLP components that compare
objects -- especially Strings -- and return a score indicating how
similar they are.  It is used in our WordNet-, Named Entity-, embedding-, 
and paraphrase-based similarity code to simplify integration of 
different similarity resources.
