Rep. Peter King said fellow Republican Sen. Rand Paul owes the nation's top intelligence official an apology after saying he should resign for ``lying'' to a Senate committee about a controversial surveillance program.
The New York congressman also said that Paul's comparison of National Intelligence Director James Clapper to NSA leaker Edward Snowden is "absolutely disgraceful."
"For Senator Paul to compare that patriot, General Clapper, with someone like Snowden, who is a traitor, who has put American lives at risk - Senator Paul should be ashamed of himself," King said Thursday on CNN's ``The Situation Room.''
Speaker of the House John Boehner could not be reached for comment.
