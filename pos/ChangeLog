  * LBJPOS 1.0.1 released.
  * The labelOrBaseline classifier now checks POSTagger's static isTraining
    field instead of Train.TRAINING to determine how to compute the feature.
  * Added the 'test' rule to the Makefile, which requires that a test data set
    exists.

Wed Jun 13 00:22:00 CDT 2007 Nick Rizzolo <rizzolo@gmail.com>

  * LBJPOS 1.1.0 released.
  * The tagger now uses SparseAveragedPerceptron and achieves better
    performance with less training.

  * LBJPOS 1.1.1 released.
  * This software is now released under the Illinois Open Source License.  For
    more information, see the file LICENSE.

  * LBJPOS 1.1.2 released.
  * Retrained the tagger with the appropriate, official Penn Treebank II WSJ
    data.
  * POSTagPlain now utilizes the new ChildrenFromVector and WordSplitter
    classes from the LBJ2.nlp package.
  * POSTagPlain now converts bracket tokens to "-LRB-" and "-RRB-" as
    appropriate.

Sat May 10 00:51:19 CDT 2008 Nick Rizzolo <rizzolo@gmail.com>

  * LBJPOS 1.1.4 released.
  * The wordForm classifier is introduced as a feature extracting classifier,
    and it takes care of converting brackets to the form in which they are
    observed during training.

Fri Mar  6 17:43:44 CST 2009 Nick Rizzolo <rizzolo@gmail.com>

  * LBJPOS 1.2.0 released.
  * The tagger now uses two learned models when making its decision.  One
    model is applied to words that were observed during training, and the
    other is applied to words that weren't.  Mikheev rules are used to create
    confusion sets for the previously unseen words.

  * All classes are now contained in edu.illinois.cs.cogcomp.lbj.pos.
  * Added the edu.illinois.cs.cogcomp.lbj.pos.TestPOS program that simply runs
    TestDiscrete on labeled testing data.
  * The edu.illinois.cs.cogcomp.lbj.pos.POSTagPlain program no longer prints
    the three field bracketed form in which the first field was always null.
    Now it's the usual two field form.
