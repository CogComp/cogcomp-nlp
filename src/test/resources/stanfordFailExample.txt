U.S. State Department official says diplomacy will work with Iran, over time .
BOSTON 2007-04-12 04:15:40 UTC .
If given enough time, diplomatic efforts to squeeze Iran economically and isolate the country politically will derail its mission to develop nuclear weapons and destabilize Iraq, an official with the U.S. State Department said.
R. Nicholas Burns, undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department, spoke at a luncheon at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on Wednesday, the same day military officials said said Iraqi insurgents were being trained in Iran to assemble sophisticated roadside bombs that have killed at least 170 U.S. troops.
Burns was asked at what point military action would supplant diplomacy in dealing with Iran, if the military continues to gather evidence of Iranian involvement in harming U.S. troops. "Hard to say," he said. "We'll have to see. I'm just reluctant to answer a question like that."
During his remarks, Burns said force must be an option as the U.S. works to end Iran's nuclear weapons program and stop it from financing Mideast terror. But he said military conflict with Iran was neither "inevitable or desirable" and said Iran's divided regime was susceptible to international pressure.
He cited as progress the recent United Nations sanctions against Iran for its refusal to halt its nuclear weapons program and said the U.S. military's capture of Iranians operating in Iraq has sent a message that interference in Iraq will not be tolerated.
Burns also said a "global whispering campaign" had curtailed lending from international banks to Iran by exposing Iran's use of false companies to launder money for terrorists.
"Sooner or later, I think the mullahs in Iran are going to have to realize that they won't be able to survive if their trade and investment channels are cut off and they become the great international pariah, which they are quickly on the road to becoming," he said.
Burns said Iran had further isolated itself by detaining 15 British sailors, then releasing them last week as an Easter "gift," and rejected criticism that the British response to the crisis had emboldened Iran. John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wrote that Britain's "passive, hesitant, almost acquiescent approach," made the West appear weak and reduced the slim chance of a negotiated end to Iran's nuclear weapons program.
"I think he's wrong," Burns said of Bolton.
"I think the aftermath is the Iranians have been isolated by this incident," Burns said. "There was widespread global disapproval for what they did. ... It didn't help them one bit."
He also denied charges by an Iranian diplomat, who said Wednesday on Iranian television that he was tortured by the CIA after being detained in Iraq.
The U.S. and Iran have had virtually no contact since the end of the Iranian hostage crisis in January 1981, Burns said, and diplomatic relations must eventually be restored. The countries have lists of grievances against each other, including Iran's seizure of the U.S. embassy in 1979 and the 1988 downing of Iranian passenger jet by a U.S. warship that mistook it for a fighter jet.
