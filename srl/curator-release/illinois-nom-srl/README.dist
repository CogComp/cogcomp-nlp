Illinois Nominal SRL Server
======================

Description
-----------

This package wraps the Illinois Nominal Semantic Role Labeler as a
Thrift server using the Curator's Parser interface. It is designed to
be integrated into the Curator system. Parsers return a forests; in
this case, consisting of one tree per predicate, with the predicate as
the root and its arguments as the children.


Semantics
----------

Semantic Roles are represented using a forest consisting of two level
trees. Each predicate in the input is associated with a tree whose
root corresponds to the predicate. The children of this node denote
the labeled arguments of the predicate.
