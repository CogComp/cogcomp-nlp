Bernstein, a CNN contributor whose reporting for the Washington Post helped topple Nixon in the 1970s, said Sunday on CNN's "Reliable Sources" that he is concerned Republicans in Congress haven't voiced more skepticism of President Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last week.

Comey's department was investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

"The Republicans during Watergate were heroic. They are the ones who said, 'What did the president know, and when did he know it?'" Bernstein said.

He added that those Republicans investigated and supported the impeachment of Nixon "because they were willing to see the truth served." Nixon resigned before a trial in the U.S. Senate could happen.

Bernstein said there has not been "something similar" yet from Republicans today. He said while "numerous" members of the party have been quietly critical of Trump, conservative leadership has been either silent or supportive of him.
