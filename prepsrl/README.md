# PrepSRL: Preposition Semantic Role Labeler 

This software identifies semantic relations expressed by prepositions and develops statistical learning models for 
predicting the relations, their arguments and the semantic types of the arguments. 
It is based on an inventory of 32 relations, building on the word sense disambiguation task for prepositions 
and collapsing related senses across prepositions. Given a preposition in a sentence, our computational task to jointly
model the preposition relation and its arguments along with their semantic types, as a way to support the relation prediction.
