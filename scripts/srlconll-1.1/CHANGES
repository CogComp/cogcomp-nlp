Version 1.1 
===========

2005/12/01 : (preliminary) added support for NomBank-0.8 in link_tbpb.pl

2005/04/14 : 

The Start-End format accepts phrase types that contain "\*". Note that
the asterisk is escaped.  

In version 1.0, we assumed that phrase types did not contain the "*"
character, and that the first occurrence of "*" corresponded to the
separation between the start and end tags. It happens that the Collins
trees with head information (the "synt.col2h" files) do have "\*"
within the string that represents the node type.

This change affects the methods "load_SE_tagging" of SRL::phrase_set
and SRL::syntree classes.
