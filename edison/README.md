# illinois-edison

`Edison` is a feature extraction framework that uses the data structures of [illinois-core-utilities](../core-utilities/README.md)
to extract features used in NLP applications.

This library has been successfully used to facilitate the feature extraction for several higher level
NLP applications like semantic role labeling, coreference
resolution, textual entailment, paraphrasing and relation
extraction which use information across several views over text to
make a decision.
