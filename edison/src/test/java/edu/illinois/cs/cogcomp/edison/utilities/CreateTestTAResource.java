Atto, a former financier-turned political enemy of south Mogadishu warlord General Mohamed Farah Aidid, heads a faction opposed to Aidid in the United Somali Congress/Somali National Alliance (USC/SNA) which controls the southern half of the war-torn Somali capital. Addressing newsmen here on Saturday, Sterken said that his delegation intended to meet all faction leaders who are agreeable to dialogue, as \"there is no way one can obtain peace, except through dialogue.\" \"We also intend to extend our invitation for dialogue to all representatives of the majority, as we believe that the majority should rule, that is democracy. That's the concrete message we have for Somalis,\" Sterken said. Asked whether they would invite General Aidid for talks on the peace initiative, Sterken said they had already held talks with Aidid's representative in the Egyptian capital Cairo and at Nairobi in neighbouring Kenya. The official was Abdurahman Ahmed Ali \"Tuur\", the deputy president in Aidid's yet to be recognised government, who welcomed the new German peace efforts. The German delegation was sent by Germany's Asocication for the Promotion of International Understanding, an organisation that consists of the country's leading former parliamentarians.";
