/**
 * Given two constituents, indicates distance between the two. The distance is
 * quantized into one of {0,1,2,3, many} and negatives indicate before. For
 * multi-word constituents, the distance is between the end of the first one and
 * the start of the second.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Important note</b>: To be able to specify the two constituents as input,
 * the feature extractor assumes the following convention: The constituent that
 * is specified as a parameter to the getFeatures function has an incoming
 * relation from the first constituent. Furthermore, this incoming relation
 * should be the only such relation.
 * <p/>
 * This convention does not limit the expressivity in any way because the two
 * constituents could be created on the spot before calling the feature
 * extractor.
