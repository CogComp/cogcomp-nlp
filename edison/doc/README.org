* Installation and configuration
  Installing edison is as simple as adding the jars to your Java
  classpath. This gives you the core functionality and you can start
  using TextAnnotations, Views, Constituents and Relations.
  
  There are a few options to configure.

  1. In order to use the Curator interface, you need to know the host
     and the port of the curator server.

  2. To use WordNet, you need to provide the location of the WordNet
     dictionaries. Edison comes with a configuration file at
     config/jwnl_properties.xml to configure WordNet. Change the value
     of /dictionary_path/ to point to your WordNet dictionary
     location. (Typically, this is $YOUR_WORDNET_DIRECTORY/dict.)
