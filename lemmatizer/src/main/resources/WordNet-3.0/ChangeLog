Changes between WordNet 2.1 and 3.0

Some changes were made to the graphical interface and WordNet library
with regard to adjective and adverb searches.  The adjective search
"Synonyms/Related Nouns" was relabeled "Synonyms", and, similarly, the
adverb search "Synonyms/Stem Adjectives" was relabled "Synonyms".  A
separate "Related Noun" search was inserted for adjectives, and a
separate "Base Adjective" search was added for adverbs.
