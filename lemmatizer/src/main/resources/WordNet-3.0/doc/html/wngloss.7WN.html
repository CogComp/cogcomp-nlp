<H3><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">System Description </A></H3>
The 
WordNet system consists of lexicographer files, code to convert these 
files into a database, and search routines and interfaces that display 
information from the database.  The lexicographer files organize nouns, 
verbs, adjectives and adverbs into groups of synonyms, and describe relations 
between synonym groups. <B><A HREF="grind.1WN.html">grind</B>(1WN)</A>
 converts the lexicographer files into 
a database that encodes the relations between the synonym groups.  The 
different interfaces to the WordNet database utilize a common library 
of search routines to display these relations.  Note that the lexicographer 
files and  <B><A HREF="grind.1WN.html">grind</B>(1WN)</A>
 program are not generally distributed.   <P>
  
<H3><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">Database 
Organization </A></H3>
Information in WordNet is organized around logical groupings 
called synsets.  Each synset consists of a list of synonymous words or 
collocations (eg. <B>"fountain pen" </B>, <B>"take in" </B>), and pointers that describe 
the relations between this synset and other synsets.  A word or collocation 
may appear in more than one synset, and in more than one part of speech. 
 The words in a synset are grouped such that they are interchangeable 
in some context. <P>
 Two kinds of relations are represented by pointers: lexical 
and semantic.  Lexical relations hold between semantically related  word 
forms; semantic relations hold between word meanings.  These relations 
include (but are not limited to) hypernymy/hyponymy (superordinate/subordinate), 
 antonymy, entailment, and meronymy/holonymy. <P>
 Nouns and verbs are organized 
into hierarchies based on the hypernymy/hyponymy relation between synsets. 
 Additional pointers are be used to indicate other relations.   <P>
 Adjectives 
are arranged in clusters containing head synsets and satellite synsets. 
 Each cluster is organized around antonymous pairs (and occasionally antonymous 
triplets).  The antonymous pairs (or triplets) are indicated in the head 
synsets of a cluster.  Most head synsets have one or more satellite synsets, 
each of which represents a concept that is similar in meaning to the concept 
represented by the head synset.  One way to think of the adjective cluster 
organization is to visualize a wheel, with a head synset as the hub and 
satellite synsets as the spokes.  Two or more wheels are logically connected 
via antonymy, which can be thought of as an axle between the wheels. <P>
 Pertainyms 
are relational adjectives and do not follow the structure just described. 
 Pertainyms do not have antonyms; the synset for a pertainym most often 
contains only one word or collocation and a lexical pointer to the noun 
that the adjective is "pertaining to".  Participial adjectives have lexical 
pointers to the verbs that they are derived from. <P>
 Adverbs are often derived 
from adjectives, and sometimes have antonyms; therefore the synset for 
an adverb usually contains a lexical pointer to the adjective from which 
it is derived. <P>
 See <B><A HREF="wndb.5WN.html">wndb</B>(5WN)</A>
 for a detailed description of the database 
files and how the data are represented.   
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4">GLOSSARY OF TERMS </A></H2>
Many terms 
used in the <I>WordNet Reference Manual </I> are unique to the WordNet system. 
 Other general terms have specific meanings when used in the WordNet documentation. 
 Definitions for many of these terms are given to help with the interpretation 
and understanding of the reference manual, and in the use of the WordNet 
system. <P>
 In following definitions <B>word </B> is used in place of <B>word or collocation
