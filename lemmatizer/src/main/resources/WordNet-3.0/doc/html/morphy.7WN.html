morphy - discussion of WordNet's morphological processing  
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1">DESCRIPTION 
</A></H2>
Although only base forms of words are usually stored in WordNet, searches 
may be done on inflected forms.  A set of morphology functions, Morphy, 
is applied to the search string to generate a form that is present in 
WordNet. <P>
 Morphology in WordNet uses two types of processes to try to convert 
the string passed into one that can be found in the WordNet database. There 
are lists of inflectional endings, based on syntactic category, that can 
be detached from individual words in an attempt to find a form of the 
word that is in WordNet.  There are also exception list files, one for 
each syntactic category, in which a search for an inflected form is done. 
 Morphy tries to use these two processes in an intelligent manner to translate 
the string passed to the base form found in WordNet.  Morphy first checks 
for exceptions, then uses the rules of detachment.  The Morphy functions 
are not independent from WordNet. After each transformation, WordNet is 
searched for the resulting string in the syntactic category specified. 
<P>
 The Morphy functions are passed a string and a syntactic category.  A 
string is either a single word or a collocation.  Since some words, such 
as <B>axes </B> can have more than one base form (<B>axe </B> and <B>axis </B>), Morphy works 
in the following manner.  The first time that Morphy is called with a specific 
string, it returns a base form. For each subsequent call to Morphy made 
with a  <FONT SIZE=-1><B>NULL </B></FONT>
  string argument, Morphy returns another base form.  Whenever 
Morphy cannot perform a transformation, whether on the first call for 
a word or subsequent calls, <FONT SIZE=-1><B>NULL </B></FONT>
  is returned.  A transformation to a 
valid English string will return  <FONT SIZE=-1><B>NULL </B></FONT>
  if the base form of the string 
is not in WordNet. <P>
 The morphological functions are found in the WordNet 
library.  See <B><A HREF="morph.3WN.html">morph</B>(3WN)</A>
 for information on using these functions.    
<H3><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">Rules 
of Detachment </A></H3>
The following table shows the rules of detachment used by 
Morphy.  If a word ends with one of the suffixes, it is stripped from the 
word and the corresponding ending is added.  Then WordNet is searched for 
the resulting string.  No rules are applicable to adverbs. <P>

<H3><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">Exception Lists </A></H3>
There is one 
exception list file for each syntactic category.  The exception lists contain 
the morphological transformations for strings that are not regular and 
therefore cannot be processed in an algorithmic manner.  Each line of an 
exception list contains an inflected form of a word or collocation, followed 
by one or more base forms.  The list is kept in alphabetical order and 
a binary search is used to find words in these lists.  See <B><A HREF="wndb.5WN.html">wndb</B>(5WN)</A>
 for 
information on the format of the exception list files.  
<H3><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4">Single Words </A></H3>
In 
general, single words are relatively easy to process.  Morphy first looks 
for the word in the exception list.  If it is found the first base form 
is returned.  Subsequent calls with a <FONT SIZE=-1><B>NULL </B></FONT>
  argument return additional 
base forms, if present.  A <FONT SIZE=-1><B>NULL </B></FONT>
  is returned when there are no more base 
forms of the word. <P>
 If the word is not found in the exception list corresponding 
to the syntactic category, an algorithmic process using the rules of detachment 
looks for a matching suffix.  If a matching suffix is found, a corresponding 
ending is applied (sometimes this ending is a <FONT SIZE=-1><B>NULL </B></FONT>
  string, so in effect 
the suffix is removed from the word), and WordNet is consulted to see 
if the resulting word is found in the desired part of speech.  
<H3><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5">Collocations 
</A></H3>
As opposed to single words, collocations can be quite difficult to transform 
into a base form that is present in WordNet.  In general, only base forms 
of words, even those comprising collocations, are stored in WordNet, such 
as <B>attorney&nbsp;general </B>.  Transforming the collocation <B>attorneys&nbsp;general </B> 
is then simply a matter of finding the base forms of the individual words 
comprising the collocation. This usually works for nouns, therefore non-conforming 
nouns, such as <B>customs&nbsp;duty </B> are presently entered in the noun exception 
list. <P>
 Verb collocations that contain prepositions, such as <B>ask&nbsp;for&nbsp;it 
</B>, are more difficult.  As with single words, the exception list is searched 
first.  If the collocation is not found, special code in Morphy determines 
whether a verb collocation includes a preposition. If it does, a function 
is called to try to find the base form in the following manner.  It is 
assumed that the first word in the collocation is a verb and that the 
last word is a noun.  The algorithm then builds a search string with the 
base forms of the verb and noun, leaving the remainder of the collocation 
(usually just the preposition, but more words may be involved) in the 
middle.  For example, passed <B>asking&nbsp;for&nbsp;it </B>, the database search would 
be performed with <B>ask&nbsp;for&nbsp;it </B>, which is found in WordNet, and therefore 
returned from Morphy.  If a verb collocation does not contain a preposition, 
then the base form of each word in the collocation is found and WordNet 
is searched for the resulting string.  
<H3><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6">Hyphenation </A></H3>
Hyphenation also presents 
special difficulties when searching WordNet. It is often a subjective decision 
as to whether a word is hyphenated, joined as one word, or is a collocation 
of several words, and which of the various forms are entered into WordNet. 
 When Morphy breaks a string into "words", it looks for both spaces and 
hyphens as delimiters.  It also looks for periods in strings and removes 
them if an exact match is not found.  A search for an abbreviation like 
<B>oct. </B> return the synset for <B>{&nbsp;October,&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;} </B>.  Not every pattern of hyphenated 
and collocated string is searched for properly, so it may be advantageous 
to specify several search strings if the results of a search attempt seem 
incomplete.  
<H3><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7">Special Processing for nouns ending with 'ful' </A></H3>
Morphy contains 
code that searches for nouns ending with <B>ful </B> and performs a transformation 
on the substring preceeding it.  It then appends 'ful' back onto the resulting 
string and returns it. For example, if passed the nouns <B>boxesful </B>, it will 
return <B>boxful </B>.  
<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8">BUGS </A></H2>
Since many noun collocations contains prepositions, 
such as <B>line&nbsp;of&nbsp;products </B>, an algorithm similar to that used for verbs 
should be written for nouns.  In the present scheme, if Morphy is passed 
<B>lines&nbsp;of&nbsp;products </B>, the search string becomes <B>line&nbsp;of&nbsp;product </B>, which 
is not in WordNet <P>
 Morphy will allow non-words to be converted to words, 
if they follow one of the rules described above.  For example, it will 
happily convert <B>plantes </B> to <B>plants </B>.
